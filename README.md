Unity3d Force Directed Graph

There is no open source(Unity3D) to look at with Google. (only youtube :( )
So I created a unity3d graph with vertices and edges.(Of course, it was not optimized, but it was made with an arbitrary algorithm.)

It is not easy to use and does not yet support public value or external files (json, xml).

The current graph only supports m x m matrices, and the length of the truncation is 1: 1 matched to the coordinates on the Unity.

Here's what will be updated in the future: I am currently making it by myself, but because it is an open source project, I will immediately reflect if contributors help.

1. File I / O and json, xml available
2. Vertex (node), edge adjacency list (currently supports only adjacency matrix)
3. UGUI
4. Initialization Random coordinates (vertex) regeneration
5. Line, point design change

If you want to give me an idea, write it on the issue.
